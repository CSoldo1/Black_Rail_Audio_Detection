# Overview

The purpose of this project was to create a machine-learning model that could detect the mating call ("kick-ee-doo" or "kick-kick-ee-doo") of black rails from .wav files.

## Background

The Eastern Black Rail (Laterallus jamaicensis jamaicensis) is a secretive marsh bird whose historic range extended throughout most of the eastern United States. Black Rails were recently listed by the US Fish & Wildlife Service as Threatened; Florida has them listed as state-endangered. Black Rails primarily breed in shallow, heavily vegetated coastal marsh habitat; however, increased sea-level rise and urban development have drastically reduced the breeding population. Florida boasts a wide variety of non-traditional Black Rail habitats: stormwater treatment areas, impoundments, and non-tidal, interior lake marshes. Because Black Rails are small, cryptic, and less vocal than other marsh birds, standard visual and audial surveys are often ineffective. Autonomous recording units (ARUs) are increasingly being utilized by scientists to monitor Black Rails because they are relatively cheap, easy to deploy, and can be programmed to record throughout the day and night. However, ARUs can easily accrue hundreds of hours of recordings, which are onerous and time-consuming to sift through.

## Task
Create a machine learning model that will sift through hour-long audio files and identify Black Rail calls. 

## Resources
* Hundred of hour-long .wav files collected with Song Meter SM4 from Wildlife Acoustics
* Black Rail audio files from Xeno Canto
* Jupyter Notebook
